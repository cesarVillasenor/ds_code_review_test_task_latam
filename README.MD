# Test Task Code Reviewers

### Given

- In the `test_project_7.ipynb` file is an example of real code that a student has submitted for a task.
- On the same notebook there is the text of the task and the general student requirements for the code project.

### What you should do

- You need to review this code. Find errors, inaccuracies, inefficient places in it, or give some optional recommendations for improvement.
- You can make a fork of the repository or gist (do not send a Pull Request to this repository) and place comments on the problematic lines in `test_project_7.ipynb`.
- Keep in mind that you are "reviewing" the student, that is, you do not just need to correct mistakes, you need to leave comments and recommendations.
